edumpfs - a program to given information pertaining to one or more
 	  Berkeley Fast File Systems in the specified AmigaDOS device.


Edumpfs enables the user to find out file system information for the
specified AmigaDOS device.  Specifically, edumpfs will tell if a disk
partition label can be found.  If one can be found, edumpfs will print
the partitioning layout for either Sun or BSD disk labels.  edumpfs
knows how to properly decode x86 BSD FFS filesystem information as well.


Next, edumpfs will attempt to show the first superblock in the
partition.  Following the superblock will be the filesystem cylinder
group summary information.  This process will be repeated for every
partition found in the disk label.  If you specify (on the command
line) the exact partition you want edumpfs to show, only that
partition will be displayed.  This is done by typing the partition
letter (or number) following the AmigaDOS device name.
ie: "edumpfs bf0:c"

edumpfs provides its own online help by typing edumpfs with no
parameters at the command line.  For more help, you can type
"edumpfs -h"

Briefly, the command line options edumpfs supports are:

-l	do not read boot label information
-b	do not show boot label information
-s	do not show superblock information
-c	do not show cylinder group summary information
-i	show bit detail of inodes available
-f	show bit detail of frags available
-h	give more help
