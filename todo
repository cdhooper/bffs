BFFS hanging someone's UUCP polling machine solid
	Joe Vasher

got GURU when I ^C'ed dumpfs in the middle of cg info

dumpfs has enforcer hit when mountlist is wrong (can't open device)
	can't find this

filesystem puked on a large recursive copy - dir levels?

fs created messy directory entry - and allocated inode - wierd
zmodem send crashed when using TERM with fs
did not do it to me and vlt
	haven't been able to duplicate yet

filesystem crashes when disk ejected and info packet is sent
seems to work fine with the stat command, however.  Testers
have not been able to get this to happen

implement readlink, then document
	1: BPTR Lock on directory that ARG2 is relative to
	2: CPTR Path and name of link (relative to ARG1)
	3: Buffer for new path string
	4: LONG Size of buffer in bytes
	R1: LONG Actual length of returned string.
		-2 if not enough space, -1 for other errors
	R2: Failure code.  

add requester notification of disk read and write errors - allow for
retry on the IO operation (in data_read and data_write routines)
maybe also, if the trackdisk IO error was disk change, demand that the
disk be returned to the drive

when disk changed, have data_read and data_write routines demand the
same disk be returned - set up superblock id structure that can be
used to identify the correct disk (update the in memory structure
only when the superblock is read from or written to the disk)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NEXT VERSION:
work on allocation policy of block_fragblock_find - seems just a little
too greedy for new filesystem blocks

use cg_rotor for last used block
use cg_frotor for last used frag

Allow for "devices" - files that cause programs to be run to
	intercept reads and writes - store filename and parms in device file
	or at least handle names like hddisk.device
	use symlink mechanism - symlink must be in format
		::device,unit,lun,flags,startblk,endblk		-or-
		::volumename:					-or maybe-
		::program					-or-
	store the information in the direct block addresses of inode (12 * 4 chars)?

Allow mounting of other filesystems at mount points

add to env? RDBPartitionName, if possible
	yes....just require device name and partition name for AmigaDOS RDB disks

make bffstool able to edit the cache_size and cache_cg_size fields

add two parameters for writes - be able to customize how
	many dirty blocks in cache before write flush and
	how many blocks may be just dumped into the cache
	instead of scheduling a disk write for that data (in file_write)

add DISK16 and DISK32 references for all disk data
	idisk, widisk, and cidisk (return value is converted form)
	superblock?  hm..what to do.
		create converted superblock for fs use, then convert back
		to write it out to disk
	don't forget:
		dir block routines (dir ent size and reclen)
		iblock deallocate
	what about the block and inode avail maps?
		does Intel screw those too?  hm.....since the bits
		are in the right order, maybe just change the block
		addr to reflect intel  ie:  block 0 -> 3,   1 -> 2
		  : xor lower two bits with 11   00 -> 11, 01 -> 10
						

optimize operations which do / and % for the macros

make cache_append routine to be called when adding blk zero'd cache
blocks into the cache - so they don't look like they've just been used

add to bffstool
	ability to change max writeback frags
	ability to change dirty automatic flush frags

make packet global
