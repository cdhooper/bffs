Cache
    Integrate cg caching with main block caching?
	NO - different block sizes between frag and cg block
    Cache cgs the same as regular blocks?
	Or add cgs with addbuffers +-10000 and value to documentation

    Cache speedup with write-behind
	Add async nature to blocks in cache - cache should wait if async
	pending.  If previous block already in cache, then sync request
	current block and async request next block.

    Add async reads and writes, but only allow one at a time.
	Read or write must be complete before packet return from handler;
	may not be possible because how system uses cache code.  May only
	be useful for direct file reads and writes.

    Make cache_append() to be called when adding blk zero'd cache blocks
	into the cache - so they don't look like they've just been used.

Note in doc file that if using csh and UnixPaths turned on, that ..
    will take user to root (csh converts .. to /)

Change version info such that sd1a is no longer printed
    only if partition is other than 'a', then give slice number
    after :

Allocation
    Work on allocation policy of block_fragblock_find() - seems just a
	little too greedy for new filesystem blocks

    Use cg_rotor for last used block
    Use cg_frotor for last used frag

Performance
    Optimize operations which do / and % for the macros

Errors
    Add requester notification of disk read and write errors - allow for
    retry on the IO operation (in data_read and data_write routines)

    When disk changed, have data_read and data_write routines request the
    same disk be returned - set up superblock id structure that can be
    used to identify the correct disk (update the in memory structure
    only when the superblock is read from or written to the disk)

New features
    Implement ACTION_SET_FILE_SIZE
    Implement immutable file?
    Implement whiteout entries?

    Add action notify stuff for files/directory locks
	Easy to do files, tough to do directories
	- add another field in the lock structure
	At action end (for write) go through all locks looking
		for lock on current file or parent directory.
		if notify set for those, notify the requester

----------------------------------------------------------------------

More possible features below

Allow for "pipes" - files that cause programs to be run to
    intercept reads and writes - store filename and parms in device file
    or at least handle names like hddisk.device
    use symlink mechanism - symlink must be in format
	::device,unit,lun,flags,startblk,endblk		-or-
	::volumename:					-or maybe-
	::program					-or-
    store the information in the direct block addresses of inode (12 * 4 chars)?

Allow mounting of other filesystems at mount points

Make BFFS just require device driver and partition name or number on RDB disks
    Advantage is that user would not need to lookup mountlist parameters.
    Add to env? RDBPartitionName, if possible

Write stripe.device, mirror.device, or raid.device?

From Todd Vierling
 -  muFS style file protection?
    (add muFS stuff under #ifdef MUFS)

 - The ability to stale a file, deleting underneath a lock?

From Bernardo Innocenti
 - Please support Sun's UFS.  I have a SparcStation 4
   at home and I'd like to be able to read its hard disk
   on my Amiga.

 - Compile it with SAS/C: code isn't as optimized as
   the one produced by GCC, but SAS/C is much more clever
   with Amiga register calls to libraries.

 - What about a 020 version?  Would it help?

 - Please support the shutdown.library.  It would come
   useful for syncing the filesystem when user hits
   Control-Amiga-Amiga.
