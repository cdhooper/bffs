when fs block filled, clrbit cg_clustersfree(newcg), frag/fs->fs_frag
if contigsumsize > 0    when freed, setbit same
ref fsck:pass5.c:267

2048 byte sector size - change TD_SECTOR and DEV_BSIZE to variable
	watch out for:	superblock offset
			inode file block size (fwrite etc)

eliminate the conversion to TD_SECTOR buffers in the code, go
strictly by the number of buffers the user really wants

rename cache.c to cache_frag.c and create new cache_block.c which
uses similar policies, but works on whole filesystem blocks.  May
need call into cache code now for external routines (packets.c),
maybe not.
integrate cg caching with main block caching?
    NO - different block sizes between frag and cg block
Cache cgs the same as regular blocks?
    Or add cgs with addbuffers +-10000 and value to documentation

Note in doc file that if using csh and UnixPaths turned on, that ..
will take user to root (csh converts .. to /)

make els show destination name of symlink (Readlink)

change version info such that sd1a is no longer printed
only if partition is other than 'a', then give slice number
after :

implement immutable file?
implement whiteout entries?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

cache speedup?
    add async nature to blocks in cache - cache should wait if async pending
    if previous block already in cache, then sync request current block
	and async request next block

add async reads and writes, but only allow one at a time.
read or write must be complete before packet return
from handler; may not be possible because how system uses
cache code.  May only be useful for direct file reads
and writes.

add action notify stuff for files/directory locks
	easy to do files, tough to do directories
	- add another field in the lock structure
	at action end (for write) go through all locks looking
		for lock on current file or parent directory.
		if notify set for those, notify the requester


add requester notification of disk read and write errors - allow for
retry on the IO operation (in data_read and data_write routines)
maybe also, if the trackdisk IO error was disk change, demand that the
disk be returned to the drive

when disk changed, have data_read and data_write routines request the
same disk be returned - set up superblock id structure that can be
used to identify the correct disk (update the in memory structure
only when the superblock is read from or written to the disk)

work on allocation policy of block_fragblock_find - seems just a little
too greedy for new filesystem blocks

use cg_rotor for last used block
use cg_frotor for last used frag

Allow for "pipes" - files that cause programs to be run to
    intercept reads and writes - store filename and parms in device file
    or at least handle names like hddisk.device
    use symlink mechanism - symlink must be in format
	::device,unit,lun,flags,startblk,endblk		-or-
	::volumename:					-or maybe-
	::program					-or-
    store the information in the direct block addresses of inode (12 * 4 chars)?

Allow mounting of other filesystems at mount points

add to env? RDBPartitionName, if possible
	just require device name and partition name for AmigaDOS RDB disks
	hm...how do I find the rdb names?

optimize operations which do / and % for the macros

make cache_append routine to be called when adding blk zero'd cache
blocks into the cache - so they don't look like they've just been used

write stripe.device
write mirror.device

for i386 write support
work on superblock references everywhere
work on bit manipulation routines?
    bit_chk and others probably need new macros written
    for little endian machines...maybe no change needed though

From Todd Vierling
  muFS style file protection?
    add muFS stuff under #ifdef MUFS

  the ability to stale a file, deleting underneath a lock?

From Bernardo Innocenti
 - Please support Sun's UFS.  I have a SparcStation 4
   at home and I'd like to be able to read its hard disk
   on my Amiga.

 - Compile it with SAS/C: code isn't as optimized as
   the one produced by GCC, but SAS/C is much more clever
   with Amiga register calls to libraries.

 - What about a 020 version?  Would it help?

 - Please support the shutdown.library.  It would come
   useful for syncing the filesystem when user hits
   Control-Amiga-Amiga.
