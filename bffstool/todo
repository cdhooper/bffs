add to bffstool
	make bffstool able to edit the cache_size and cache_cg_size fields
	    (send something like a add buffers packet?)
	ability to change max writeback frags
	ability to change dirty automatic flush frags
	ability to change min buffered threshold
	ability to change max cache invalidate read threshold
add two parameters for writes - be able to customize how
	many dirty blocks in cache before write flush and
	how many blocks may be just dumped into the cache
	instead of scheduling a disk write for that data (in file_write)

From Bernardo Innocenti
 - Please release full sources of BFFS, someone might
   want to improve it or even make another FS out of it.

 - Please support Sun's UFS.  I have a SparcStation 4
   at home and I'd like to be able to read its hard disk
   on my Amiga.

 - Improve BFFSTool to support big screen fonts and
   non standard window border sizes.  On my system
   the GUI looks awful!  What about using MUI or
   some other GUI system?

 - Compile it with SAS/C: code isn't as optimized as
   the one produced by GCC, but SAS/C is much more clever
   with Amiga register calls to libraries.

 - Please try to reduce memory usage: 48K for a fs seems
   to be a lot.  Perhaps you could make a small version
   which only recognizes BSD 4.4 partitions.

 - What about a 020 version?  Would it help?

 - Please support the shutdown.library.  It would come
   useful for syncing the filesystem when user hits
   Control-Amiga-Amiga.

 - Please support multiuser.library.  It shouldn't be
   hard to do.  I think the author has discontinued
   developement, but full source code is available.

 - I'd like to be able to keep Amiga specific protection
   bits, such as S, P and A.  Is it possible without
   compromising the inode format?
