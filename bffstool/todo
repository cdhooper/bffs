add to bffstool
	make bffstool able to edit the cache_size and cache_cg_size fields
	    (send something like a add buffers packet?)
	ability to change max writeback frags
	ability to change dirty automatic flush frags
	ability to change min buffered threshold
	ability to change max cache invalidate read threshold
add two parameters for writes - be able to customize how
	many dirty blocks in cache before write flush and
	how many blocks may be just dumped into the cache
	instead of scheduling a disk write for that data (in file_write)

From Bernardo Innocenti
 - Improve BFFSTool to support big screen fonts and
   non standard window border sizes.  On my system
   the GUI looks awful!  What about using MUI or
   some other GUI system?

 - Please support multiuser.library.  It shouldn't be
   hard to do.  I think the author has discontinued
   developement, but full source code is available.
