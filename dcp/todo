make dcp capable of async copies

do direct file packet reads/writes instead of going through Dos
	this will require a filesystem lock, msgport, and msgbuf allocation
for stdio, leave as is

in the case of -a (async) option:
	split buffer in half (so there are two)
		and set up "in use/idle" flag for buffer
	for devices, allocate two trackIO structures
		DoIO becomes SendIO
	for files, allocate two msgbufs
	main copy loop would then function like:
		if no buffer available, wait on a message from handler/device
		do normal operation (either read or write) with free buffer
