ln - create symbolic links


This program acts nearly identical to the UNIX command of the same name.


Type:
	eln {-s} [destination] [source] {source . . . }

Where
	-s means create a soft link
		otherwise, a hard link to the destination is created

	destination is the required object which will be pointed to
		by the link.

	source is the name of the link which will point to the
		destination.

	You are allowed to name as many link names as you want to
		point at a single destination.
