DISCLAIMER
----------
The BSD filesystem for AmigaDOS was derived in part from the 1983
BSD 4.2 paper, "A Fast File System for UNIX" - Marshall Kirk McKusick,
William N. Joy, Samuel J. Leffler, Robert S. Fabry of the University
of California at Berkeley (Computer Systems Research Group).

A modified version of the Berkeley BSD Tahoe include files are used
as part of this program.  However, at no point during development was
the Berkeley ufs filesystem source code consulted for ideas, techniques,
algorithms, or other such aid in the development of this filesystem.
Because of this, the filesystem is claimed to be compatible only
with regard to data structure and not necessarily organization nor
algorithmic policies.

The programs fsck, mkfs, and diskpart were ported from BSD Tahoe
to AmigaDOS by Chris Hooper.  The programs were modified heavily to
accommodate AmigaDOS devices and reduce the system stack requirements.
Because of this a warning must be issued that the operation of these
programs may not be identical from their original sources, and may
perform incorrectly with respect to the original implementation.

The programs dumpfs, dcp, ln, and bffstool are utilities created
mainly to support development of the filesystem.  As with the rest of
the software in this distribution you may not expect these utilities
to perform without system crashes or loss of data.

All aforementioned programs may do more harm than good to affected
media.  I, in no way, guarantee correctness of the product and will
not be held responsible for its use (or misuse).  This includes all
damages incurred and loss of business.

This package represents a culmination of (off and on) two years work
on my part.  All development was done on my own equipment.  In no
way do my employers, past or present, lay claim to ownership or the
responsibilities thus implied by the distribution of this software.
