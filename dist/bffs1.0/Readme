Version 1.3 of BFFS  (Read-Write)      Distribution is 12-25-93
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Berkeley Fast Filesystem (©) for AmigaDOS.

BFFSFilesystem allows you to mount (and use) Unix filesystems directly
under AmigaDOS.  Function in the operating system is similar in form to
MessyDos (©) by Olaf Seibert or a CD-ROM filesystem for the Amiga.

This is the first read-write version of the filesystem.  And, although
I have done a fair amount of testing, you should not consider this
package stable or otherwise bug-free.

The original package (1.0 release) was co-authored by Bill Moore and
Chris Hooper.  Bill Moore has since acquired other projects, so this
product will be maintained and supported entirely by Chris Hooper.

	agree to all terms and conditions stated in the above file.

BFFSFileSystem - Berkeley FFS implementation filesystem for AmigaDOS
	This is the first release of the Read-Write version of the
	filesystem.  Since it is the first release, the possibility
	of grave data corruption exists for filesystems with parameters
	which have not been tested.  Please see the program documentation
	for situations which have been tested.

user_manual - Documentation on how to get started and maintain your
	BSD filesystems under AmigaDOS.
	
MountList.BFFS  - Sample AmigaDOS mountlist for filesystem
	The information contained in this MountList is explained in
	detail in the user manual.

release_notes - Filesystem operation changes since previous releases.

bin/bffstool - Amiga gadtools utility to monitor filesystem performance
	and modify current operating parameters.  See the user manual
	for operating instructions.

bin/dumpfs - Show various Berkeley Fast Filesystem parameters; this
	includes information in the disk label (if present) as well
	as the superblock and cylinder group summary information.
	This tool requires the filesystem already be mounted.

bin/dcp - Copy from files to devices and visa versa.  See the separate
	documentation included for this package for details.

bin/ln - Create hard and soft links (usage is similar to UNIX ln command)

bin/newfs - 4.3 BSD Tahoe source ported to the Amiga.
	This program will create a new BSD filesystem within the bounds of
	the specified partition.  This tool requires the filesystem already
	be mounted.  A diskchange should be done on the partition following
	the new filesystem creation.

bin/fsck - 4.3 BSD Tahoe source ported to the Amiga
	This program will check the consistency of the filesystem specified.
	It will also NOT work correctly with SunOS 4.1.2 newfs'ed partitions,
	as Sun has changed its cylinder summary information slightly.
	The filesystem MUST be quiescent before starting fsck.  If the
	filesystem is modified, you must perform a diskchange on the
	partition to ensure continued data consistency.

bin/diskpart - 4.3 BSD Tahoe source ported to the Amiga
	This program allows you to create and/or edit the disk boot
	label information stored in the first sector of the disk
	(Amiga disk partition).  When creating a new disk label, if
	you do not specify the partition type, one will automatically
	be created for you specifying parameters which fit inside the
	the AmigaDOS partition.
