Version 1.1 of dumpfs                     Distribution is 2-Feb-94
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

dumpfs - a program to given information pertaining to one or more
	 Berkeley Fast File Systems in the specified AmigaDOS device.


Dumpfs enables the user to find out file system information for the
specified AmigaDOS device.  Specifically, dumpfs will tell if a disk
partition label can be found.  If one can be found, dumpfs will print
the partitioning layout for either Sun or BSD disk labels. 

Next, dumpfs will attempt to show the first superblock in the
partition.  Following the superblock will be the filesystem cylinder
group summary information.  This process will be repeated for every
partition found in the disk label.  If you specify (on the command
line) the exact partition you want dumpfs to show, only that
partition will be displayed.  This is done by typing the partition
letter (or number) following the AmigaDOS device name.
ie: "dumpfs bf0:c"

dumpfs provides its own online help by typing dumpfs with no
parameters at the command line.  For more help, you can type
"dumpfs -h"

Briefly, the command line options dumpfs supports are:

-l	do not read boot label information
-b	do not show boot label information
-s	do not show superblock information
-c	do not show cylinder group summary information
-i	show bit detail of inodes available
-f	show bit detail of frags available
-h	give more help
