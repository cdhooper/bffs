chown - change file ownership for both the owner and group


This program acts nearly identical to the Unix command of the same name.


Usage:
	chown owner.group filename [filename . . . ]

Where 
	owner is the uid of the file owner

	group is the gid of the file group

	filename is the name of the file to modify


	You are allowed to name as many names as you want to
		change to the specified group.

	This command does not currently handle recursive operation.
