Version 1.3 of BFFSTool                     Distribution is 31-Jan-94
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

BFFSTool - a program to monitor and modify the behavior of running
           BFFSFileSystem handlers.


BFFSTool provides a graphical "point-and-click" interface to the
internal operation of a running BFFSFileSystem handler.  The tool
performs modifications to the running filesystem by directly
manipulating static BFFS local variables.  This means that all
changes done by the user happen immediately and can be observed
while the tool is still running.

Don't be afraid to try the different buttons.  There should be
nothing you can do in BFFSTool to damage your filesystem or
permanently impair its performance.

After starting up the filesystem, you may at first be overwhelmed
with the amount of information presented.  Since this tool was
developed during debugging of the filesystem, you may find many
statistics not useful to you at all.  First I will cover the
meaning of each static, then the buttons and other gadgets will
be explained.

You can start BFFSTool by typing "bffstool" at the CLI prompt.
It will automatically search the system for all accessed (and
valid) BFFS filesystems and choose the first one found to be
displayed.  If you know the name of the device for BFFSTool to
initially select, you may specify that on the command line;
ie: "bffstool bf0:"

A window should open with the title, "Berkeley Fast Filesystem
(BFFS) status tool V1.3"  If it doesn't then no handlers were
found in the system.  In that case, you will need to consult
the documentation for correctly installing a BFFS handler.
If you have a handler installed correctly, you may have one of
two problems.  The partition must be mounted and accessed
before BFFSTool will recognize the filesystem handler as valid.
The other possible problem may be that you are attempting to
run BFFSTool with the wrong version of the BFFSFileSystem.
BFFSTool 1.3 will ONLY work with version 1.3 of BFFSFileSystem.


The window should look similar to the following:

CACHE INFORMATION:
------------------
read hits	The number of successful probes in the cache by the cache
		module for the requested disk fragment.  In general, this
		number is slightly inflated because routines outside the
		cache will often reaccess a block many times.  For later
		versions of the filesystem, this number will actually be
		lowered because more routines will start to use the new
		disk frag locking mechanism offered by the cache.
		The main disk fragment cache is LRU based, but the data
		structure features both sequential (ordered) and hashed
		access for fast block lookups.  Allocation for this
		cache occurs at filesystem started and whenever buffers
		are added or subtracted.  Note that not all reads pass
		through the cache and thus will not be reported as hits
		or misses.  Most notably, you will not see superblock or
		multiblock reads/writes noted in the cache information.
		This tends to push the cache hit rate up as those direct
		accesses would most often be cache misses.
read misses	The number of failed cache probes which required a disk
		access to satisfy the request.
write hits	The number of successful probes in the cache to access
		a disk fragment such that the fragment will have to
		eventually be written back to disk.  A disk fragment
		must already be in the cache as either clean (has only
		been read so far) or dirty (has been written at least
		once since the last flush) to be considered a hit.
write misses	The number of failed cache probes which required a disk
		access to cache the disk fragment to be modified.
cgread hits	A separate cache module controls access to the cylinder
		group summary cache.  Each cache nodes contains a chunk
		of memory as large as the disk block size.  Cached in
		that space are working cylinder group bit fields
		describing the allocated and free blocks in the active
		cylinder group(s).  This cache is also LRU ordered, but
		is not hashed because in general very few cylinder
		groups should ever be active at the same time.  The
		larger your files and the smaller your disk, the less
		individual cylinder groups I recommend.
cgread misses	The number of cache misses for cylinder group summary
		information.  Note that cylinder group summary
		information is only needed by the filesystem when
		writing to the disk.  If you never write on the 
		filesystem, then no memory will be allocated to the
		cylinder group cache (allocation for this cache is
		strictly dynamic, but bounded).
cgwrite hits	The number of cache write hits which were satisfied
		with cylinder group summary information already present
		in the cache.
cgwrite misses	The number of cache write misses which required a disk
		access to satisfy the request to modify cylinder group
		summary information.
cache moves	The number of disk fragments moved around on the disk
		via the cache write-back policy.  Cache moves often
		occur when writing files to the disk because at file
 		close, the policy of the Berkeley filesystem states
		that the filesystem must attempt to locate a partial
		filesystem block to put the last (incomplete) file
		fragments.  The cache moves take advantage of the
		possibility that the data to be moved is probably still
		in the cache, alleviating disk access.
flushes		The number of cache flushes which were requested by
		the filesystem.  You may have started to realize that
		the cache acts as an individual entity when it comes
		to disk data.  No other routines in the filesystem are
		privy to the information the cache has.  Flushes can
		occur for various reasons, but will only happen when
		the cache has dirty disk fragments to be written:
		o  The large block read or write routines are starting
		   a data access.
		o  The file deallocator wants block access to the
		   filesystem inode blocks (this also causes
		   invalidates of those fragments to occur).
		o  The cache was asked to get a disk block fragment,
		   but all cache slots are in use and the cache is
		   more than 3/4 full.  ** This 3/4 will become a user
		   configurable setting in the next release. **
		o  The write back timer expires demanding the data be
		   flushed to the disk immediately.
		o  The user sends a ACTION_FLUSH or ACTION_DIE packet
		   to the filesystem.
cg flushes	The number of cylinder group summary cache flushes which
		were requested by the filesystem.  These flushes can
		happen under any of the following circumstances:
		o  The cache was asked to get a cylinder group summary
		   block which was not in the cache, and the cache was
		   already full with other cylinder group summary blocks.
		   Only the cg summary block ejected will be immediately
		   flushed to disk.
		o  The write back timer expires demanding the data be
		   flushed to the disk immediately.
		o  The user sends a ACTION_FLUSH or ACTION_DIE packet
		   to the filesystem.
force writes	The number of cache disk frags which were requested by
		the filesystem to be written immediately to the disk.
		Also, the number of cache frags which were forced out
		of the cache by the cache being full of dirty frags
		when a new disk frag was requested.
cg force writes	The number of cylinder group summary blocks which were
		dirty and forced out to disk when accesses to other
		cylinder group summary blocks forced them out.  In
		general, this value should be zero even in an really
		active system.  If it isn't zero, I suggest bumping the
		number of cg max buffers.
destroys	The number of times the entire cache was deallocated.
		In general, this will only happen on disk change 
invalidates	The number of time the filesystem asked the cache to
		"just forget" about specified cache frags.  This will
		happen to the destination of a cache move (if it exists
		in the cache), or in the direct block write routines
		should a large write chunk overlap a cached disk
		fragment still in the cache.
cg max buffers	This is a configurable maximum number of cylinder group
		summary slots (filesystem block size memory chunks)
		which are to be dedicated to caching cylinder group
		summary information.
max buffers	This is a configurable maximum number of disk fragment
		size memory blocks which are dedicated to the main
		disk fragment cache.  This number is translatable into
		the number of buffers reported by AddBuffers; however
		AddBuffers reports this value in 512 byte blocks.  This
		may change as it's really just BFFS's interface with
		the AddBuffers command.
total buffers	The number of disk buffers allocated by the filesystem.
		In general, this number will be the same as the max
		buffers, except when the max buffers are changed from
		inside BFFSTool.  In that case, the change will not
		take effect until the next disk change, or the next
		AddBuffers command.
in use buffers	The number of cache disk fragment buffers currently in
		use by the filesystem.
dirty buffers	The number of cache disk fragment buffers which have
		not yet been written to disk.  Usually, this value will
		be zero unless the filesystem is busy writing files.
locked buffers	The number of disk fragment buffers which have been
		internally locked by the filesystem.  In general, you
		should /never/ see this value other than zero.  This is
		because the internal routines will unlock buffers
		before completion of a packet.


GENERAL HANDLER INFORMATION:
----------------------------
read opens	The number of files (successfully and unsuccessfully)
		opened for read from the disk.
read groups	The number of raw disk transfers which have been
		requested of the disk device to read.
read bytes	The number of bytes which have been requested of the
		disk device read.
write opens	The number of files (successfully and unsuccessfully)
		opened for write to the disk.
write groups	The number of raw disk transfers which have been
		requested of the disk device to write.
write bytes	The number of bytes which have been requested of the
		disk device write.
locates		The number of times an individual file was locked
		via the ACTION_LOCATE packet (Lock() in dos.library)
examines	The number of examine packets which have been sent
		to the filesystem handler by AmigaDOS.
examinenexts	The number of examine next packets which have been
		sent to the filesystem handler by AmigaDOS.
flushes		The number of times the cache was flushed by a timer
		expire or by an ACTION_FLUSH packet send manually.
renames		The number of files which have been renamed since this
		handler was started up.
sync timer	The number of seconds idle write packet time (no write
		packets have been received within this time) to flush
		out the cache data to disk.  This is so when the
		filesystem is idle, it can put the disk to use writing
		back all the cached dirty disk data (and turning the
		floppy motor off).
sync stalls	The number of seconds to retry (check is once every
		sync timer seconds) the cache flush before forcing a
		cache flush anyway.  This serves two purposes:
		o  Even in an system actively writing to the disk, the
		   filesystem gets a chance to checkpoint and sync
		   a consistent filesystem structure "often."
		o  Flushing out the cache improves performance in an
		   active system since those dirty fragments become
		   unavailable for regular filesystem use until they
		   have been synchronized with the media.
GMT offset	The number of hours (plus or minus) that the local
		time varies from GMT time.  This is mainly used to
		synchronize your AmigaDOS timestamp with the UNIX
		file timestamp (which is always GMT).
PreAlloc	Representation of the current BFFS settings usable
		if you want to mount with those settings as default.
media start	This is the byte address of the physical disk where
		the active filesystem partition is being accessed.
media end	This is the upper bounding byte address of the
		physical disk where the active filesystem partition
		is being accessed.  All data accesses are checked
		for validity within this range (to prevent media
		corruption causing additional possible corruption).
version		This is a comment field by the filesystem to describe
		the current running version of BFFS.  You will notice
		the version number followed by some letters.  The
		letters you see detail the following:
		R  Handler can handle removable media.  Your version
			will probably have this option turned on.
		E  Handler uses extended packets to talk with the
			disk device.  Since not all devices are able
			to use extended packets, your distribution
			will probably have this option turned off.
		F  Handler compiled with Fast mode.  This means that
			all filesystem consistency checking is turned
			off, but the filesystem performs much faster.
		I  Intel version.  This version of the filesystem has
			been compiled to support Intel byte ordering
			for the filesystem (ie: 386i and 386BSD).
			This automatically makes the filesystem
			incompatible with Motorola byte ordering
			filesystems, which include Sun SPARC, and
			Amiga.  This functionality is not yet
			supported, but will be in a future release.
		r  Filesystem handler is compiled to only read the
			disk and never allow writes.
		w  Filesystem handler is compiled to allow both reads
			from and writes to the disk.
		D  Filesytem is compiled with debugging messages
			turned on.  This increases the size of the
			filesystem and slows it down.  Unless you are
			running a non-distribution copy of BFFS, you
			shouldn't see this flag.
		The above flags are set at compile-time and can not
		be modified by the user of the filesystem.
disk type	This field presents information about what BFFS thinks
		it is dealing with (as far as disk structure is
		concerned).  The first text (if present) is either
		"Sun" or "BSD" if a disk partition label is present,
		and was automatically sensed by the filesystem.  Note
		that if the Reserved parameter in the MountList is -1,
		then this text will never show.  If no disk label is
		present, then the handler device name will be shown
		instead.  This field may also say "dev:Dsk?" indicating
		no disk is in the drive.  You may also see "dev:Bad?"
		which means the superblock is unreadable.  If you see
		"dev:Dev?" this suggests a problem in the MountList.
		If the disk was mounted successfully, the next part
		will have the format "%cd%d%c"  The first %c will be
		the first character of the device driver.  The %d is
		the physical unit on that device.  The last %c is the
		partition that was actually mounted.  So, for example,
		if you have a Sun floppy in bf0: (and are using
		messydisk.device or mfm.device , you should see:
		"Sun md0a"  Otherwise, if you have a Sun hard drive
		at scsi.device unit 0, you may see "Sun sd0a"


SUPERBLOCK INFORMATION:
-----------------------
frags free	The number of disk fragments which are not yet
		allocated to a file.  Note that this number should
		stay relatively small, as the filesystem attempts
		not to break full filesystem blocks if partial full
		blocks (multiple disk frags) are located nearby.
blocks free	The total number of full filesystem blocks which
		have not yet been allocated to files.
inodes free	The number of disk file descriptors still available.
		If this number falls to zero, no mores files may
		be allocated.
num dirs	The number if directories present in the filesystem.
		Note that the root directory counts as one.
frag size	The number of bytes which make up a disk fragment,
		as parameterized by the newfs command.
block size	The number of bytes which make up a full filesystem
		disk block as parameterized by the newfs command.
		Note that this value must be a multiple (from 1x to
		8x) the size of the frag size.  Also, allowed values
		for the block size are 4096, 8192, 16384, or 32768.
num inodes	The total number of inodes which were parameterized
		as available when the filesystem was created.  By
		subtracting the number of inodes free, you can get
		the number of inodes in use.
data frags	Number of total disk block fragments which are
		allocatable to disk files.  This is basically the
		total filesystem size (num frags) minus the static
		filesystem overhead allocation.
num frags	The length of the filesystem in disk block fragments.
		Note that this number is considerably more than the
		actual usable space of the filesystem.
num cgs		The number of individual disk cylinder groups
		parameterized when the filesystem was created (newfs).
num cyl		The number of disk cylinders involved in the entire
		filesystem.  This number is also chosen by newfs.
sec/track	The number of sectors in a single disk track.
track/cyl	The number of tracks (disk heads) in a single cylinder.
cyl/cg		The number of disk cylinders parameterized by newfs
		to be logically located in the same cylinder group.
frags/cg	The number of disk block fragments per cylinder group.
inodes/cg	The number of inodes parameterized by newfs to be
		available (allocated within) each cylinder group.
minfree		The minimum free disk space to report (percentage).
modified	The number of modifications to the superblock since
		the last flush.  If this is non-zero, then the disk
		is considered out of sync with memory.
clean		This value should always be zero while the handler is
		active with the disk.  It is used to indicate in the
		superblock that the filesystem was cleanly unmounted.


BUTTONS:
--------
Refresh		This button asks the filesystem for an update on the
		filesystem status information shown.
Sync		This button asks the filesystem to FLUSH its dirty
		cache disk fragments to disk immediately.  You will
		notice dirty buffers go to zero (unless the disk is
		VERY active).
Clear		Clear the value of the operating statistics.  This
		is a non-dangerous operation, as only data which
		the filesystem /only/ updates is cleared.
Quit		This button Quits BFFSTool, returning you to the CLI.
Auto Symlink	This box allows you to turn on and off the automatic
		symlink resolution of the filesystem.  For this
		release NEVER turn this flag off.  ReadLink is not
		implemented and most AmigaDOS programs will crash if
		they run into a soft link and attempt to resolve it.
Ignore Case	This box allows you to turn on and off the case
		independence you have grown used to with AmigaDOS.
		When off, multiple files may exist in the same
		directory with the same name (just different case).
		This may be necessary when trying to use a UNIX
		filesystem with files such as "Makefile" and "makefile"
Link Comments	This box allows you to turn on and off directory
		comments for "special" files; symbolic links and
		character/block special devices.
Inode Comments	This box allows you to turn on and off directory
		comments for files showing UNIX inode number,
		permissions, uid, gid, number of links, nunber of
		physical disk (512 byte) blocks, and number of bytes
		allocated to the file.  Note that directory listings
		are faster if you do not normally use comments.
Unix Paths	This box allows you to turn on and off the UNIX path
		parser.  When on / is a reference to the root
		directory.  When off, / is instead a reference to the
		parent directory.  Use this if you want BFFS to be
		compatible with some unconfigurable package.
Read Only	This box represents the superblock flag indicating
		whether this filesystem is mounted read-write or
		read-only.  You may change this status at any time.
Show Minfree	Checking this box makes the filesystem report
		available disk space as relative to the minfree
		percentage specified in the superblock.
Grp/Otr Bits	This box when checked inverts the meaning of the
		permission bits for group and other.  Apparently
		there was some late indecision made at Commodore
		regarding the final meaning of these bits.  This
		provides a temporary solution should you need it.
Handler		This is a Cycle gadget which allows you to choose
		the BFFS handler with which you want to communicate.
		Note that BFFSTool "knows" which handlers are active
		in the system and it will only let you query an
		active BFFS 1.3 or higher filesystem handler.

Finally, you will notice minitiature up/down button gadgets near
"cg max buffers", "max buffers", "sync timer", "sync stalls", and
"GMT offset." These are for incrementing and decrementing the value
of the BFFS static parameter for the filesystem.


I hate documentation.  ;)

Enjoy.
