els - Very simple directory list utility


This program acts similar to to the UNIX ls command, except it accepts
no command line parameters.


Usage:
	els [device:]filename [[device:]filename . . . ]

Where 
	device is the optional device where the file exists

	filename is the name of the file to show


	You may specify as many filenames as you want to list.

	Why does this program exist?  Only to provide a stopgap
	until the real directory lister programs are capable of
	handling the extra permission bits and owner/group.
