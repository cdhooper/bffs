Beta Testers,

This is an incomplete release of BFFS 1.5.  Much of the documentation
is missing which will be included in the real release.

Although I have attempted to test all the applications in this package
after the last compilation, there may be problems I might have overlooked.

So far, I know of the following:
    els -i and -s
	make display lines which are greater than 80 characters
	it also does not display symlink or device information,
		but that may not be fixed
