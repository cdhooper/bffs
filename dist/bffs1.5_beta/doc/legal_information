DISCLAIMER
----------
The BSD filesystem for AmigaDOS was derived in part from the 1983
BSD 4.2 paper, "A Fast File System for UNIX" - Marshall Kirk McKusick, 
William N. Joy, Samuel J. Leffler, Robert S. Fabry of the University
of California at Berkeley (Computer Systems Research Group).  It has
since been enhanced to take advantage of, and to support the
enhancements made to the FFS implementation in the BSD 4.4 Fast File
System.

A modified version of the Berkeley BSD Tahoe (and NetBSD current)
include files are used as part of this program.  However, at no point
during development was the Berkeley ufs filesystem source code consulted
for ideas, techniques, algorithms, or other such aid in the development
of this filesystem.  Because of this, the filesystem is claimed to be
compatible only with regard to data structure and not necessarily
organization nor algorithmic policies.

The programs fsck, newfs, dumpfs, diskpart, and tunefs were ported from
NetBSD source dated November 4, 1994.  Restore was ported from NetBSD
source dated October 1, 1995.  All software ports were ported through
SunOS to AmigaDOS solely by Chris Hooper.  The programs were modified
heavily to accommodate AmigaDOS devices and reduce the system stack
requirements.  Because of this a warning must be issued that the
operation of these programs may not be identical from their original
sources, and may perform incorrectly with respect to the original
implementation.

The programs BFFStool, dumpfs, dcp, echmod, echown, edumpfs, eln, els,
etouch, mknod, and rdb are utilities created originally to support
development of the filesystem.  Much effort has been placed on the
implementations to operate in the "expected" manner for users coming
from a UNIX platform.  As with the rest of the software in this
distribution it is not expressed or implied these utilities will perform
to any standards or set expectations.

All aforementioned programs may do more harm than good to affected
media.  I, in no way, guarantee correctness of the product and will
not be held responsible for its use (or misuse).  This includes all
damages incurred and loss of business.

This package and support utilities represent a culmination (much off
and much on) of five years work on my part.  All development was done
on my own equipment, and in my spare time.  In no way shall my employers,
past or present, be granted claim to ownership or the responsibilities
thus implied by this software distribution.
