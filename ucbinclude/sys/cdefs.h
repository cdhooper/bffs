 * The __CONCAT macro is used to concatenate parts of symbol names, e.g.
 * with "#define OLD(foo) __CONCAT(old,foo)", OLD(foo) produces oldfoo.
 * The __CONCAT macro is a bit tricky -- make sure you don't put spaces
 * in between its arguments.  __CONCAT can also concatenate double-quoted
 * strings produced by the __STRING macro, but this only works with ANSI C.

 * in the distribution version of 2.5.5).
