Version 1.6 of BFFSTool
------------------------------------------------------------------------

BFFSTool - a program to monitor and modify the behavior of running
           BFFSFileSystem handlers.


BFFSTool provides a graphical "point-and-click" interface to the internal
operation of a running BFFSFileSystem handler.  The tool performs
modifications to the running filesystem by directly manipulating static
BFFS local variables.  This means that all changes done by the user happen
immediately and can be observed while the tool is still running.

Don't be afraid to try the different buttons and checkboxes.  There should
be nothing you can do in BFFSTool to damage your filesystem or permanently
impair its performance.

After starting BFFSTool, you may at first be overwhelmed with the amount
of information presented.  Since this tool was developed during debugging
of the filesystem, you may find many statistics not useful to you at all.
First I will cover the meaning of each statistic, then the buttons and
other gadgets will be explained.

You can start BFFSTool by typing "bffstool" at the CLI prompt.  It will
automatically search the system for all accessed (and valid) BFFS
filesystems and choose the first one found to be displayed.  If you know
the name of the device for BFFSTool to initially select, you may specify
that on the command line; ie: "bffstool bf0:"

A window should open with the title, "Berkeley Fast Filesystem (BFFS) status
tool V1.6"  If it doesn't start, then no handlers were found in the system.
In that case, you will need to consult the documentation for correctly
installing a BFFS handler.  If you have a handler installed correctly,
you may have one of two problems.  The partition must be mounted and
accessed before BFFSTool will recognize the filesystem handler as valid.
The other possible problem may be that you are attempting to run BFFSTool
with the wrong version of the BFFSFileSystem.  BFFSTool 1.6 will ONLY
work with version 1.3 or higher of BFFSFileSystem.


The window should look similar to the following:

The above is a mediocre ASCII representation of the graphic display.


CACHE INFORMATION:
------------------
read hits	The number of successful probes in the cache by the cache
		module for the requested disk fragment.  In general, this
		number is slightly inflated because routines outside the
		cache will often reaccess a block many times.  In the future,
		this statistic will be lowered because more routines will
		use the new disk frag locking mechanism offered by the cache.
		The main disk fragment cache is LRU based, but the data
		structure features both sequential (ordered) and hashed
		access for fast block lookups.  Allocation for this
		cache occurs at filesystem startup and whenever buffers
		are added or subtracted.  Note that not all reads pass
		through the cache and thus will not be reported as hits
		or misses.  Most notably, you will not see superblock or
		multiblock reads/writes noted in the cache information.
		This tends to push the cache hit rate up as those direct
		accesses would most often be cache misses.
read misses	The number of failed cache probes which required a disk
		access to satisfy the request.
write hits	The number of successful probes in the cache to access
		a disk fragment such that the fragment will have to
		eventually be written back to disk.  A disk fragment
		must already be in the cache as either clean (has only
		been read so far) or dirty (has been written at least
		once since the last flush) to be considered a hit.
		This number is also inflated by filesystem code which needs
		to ensure a particular block is still in cache during
		operations requiring multiple disk accesses.
write misses	The number of failed cache probes which required a disk
		access to cache the disk fragment to be modified.
cgread hits	A separate cache module controls access to the cylinder
		group summary cache.  Each cache node contains a chunk
		of memory the size of a filesystem block.  Cached in that
		space are working cylinder group bit fields describing the
		allocated and free blocks in the active cylinder group(s).
		This cache is also LRU ordered, but is not hashed because
		in general very few cylinder groups should ever be active
		at the same time.  The larger your files and the smaller
		your disk, the less individual cylinder groups I recommend.
cgread misses	The number of cache misses for cylinder group summary
		information.  Note that cylinder group summary information
		is only needed by the filesystem when writing to the disk.
		If you never write on the filesystem, then no memory will
		be allocated to the cylinder group cache (allocation for
		this cache is strictly dynamic, but bounded).
cgwrite hits	The number of cache write hits which were satisfied with
		cylinder group summary information already present in the
		cache.
cgwrite misses	The number of cache write misses which required a disk access
		to satisfy the request to modify cylinder group summary
		information.
cache moves	The number of disk fragments moved around on the disk via the
		cache write-back policy.  Cache moves often occur when
		writing files to the disk because at file close, the policy
		of the Berkeley filesystem states that the filesystem must
		attempt to locate a partial filesystem block to put the
		last (incomplete) file fragments.  The cache moves take
		advantage of the possibility that the data to be moved is
		probably still in the cache, alleviating disk access.
flushes		The number of cache flushes which were requested by
		the filesystem.  You may have started to realize that
		the cache acts as an individual entity when it comes to
		disk data.  No other routines in the filesystem are privy
		to the information the cache has.  Flushes can occur for
		various reasons, but will only happen when the cache has
		dirty disk fragments to be written:
		o  The large block read or write routines are starting
		   a data access.
		o  The file deallocator wants block access to the
		   filesystem inode blocks (this also causes
		   invalidates of those fragments to occur).
		o  The cache was asked to get a disk block fragment,
		   but all cache slots are in use and the cache is
		   more than 3/4 full with dirty disk fragments.
		o  The write back timer expires demanding the data be
		   flushed to the disk immediately.
		o  The user sends a ACTION_FLUSH or ACTION_DIE packet
		   to the filesystem.
cg flushes	The number of cylinder group summary cache flushes which
		were requested by the filesystem.  These flushes can happen
		under any of the following circumstances:
		o  The cache was asked to get a cylinder group summary
		   block which was not in the cache, and the cache was
		   already full with other dirty cylinder group summary
                   blocks.  Only the ejected cg summary block will be
                   immediately flushed to disk.
		o  The write back timer expires demanding the data be
		   flushed to the disk immediately.
		o  The user sends a ACTION_FLUSH or ACTION_DIE packet
		   to the filesystem.
force writes	The number of cache disk frags which were requested by
		the filesystem to be written immediately to the disk.
		Also, the number of cache frags which were forced out
		of the cache by the cache being full of dirty frags
		when a new disk frag was requested or flush as above.
cg force writes	The number of cylinder group summary blocks which were
		dirty and forced out to disk when accesses to other
		cylinder group summary blocks required it.  In general,
                this value should be zero even in an really active system.
                If it isn't zero, I suggest increasing the number of
                cg max buffers.
destroys	The number of times the entire cache was deallocated.
		In general, this will only happen on disk change.
invalidates	The number of times the filesystem asked the cache to
		"just forget" about specified cache frags.  This will
		happen to the destination of a cache move (if it exists
		in the cache), or in the direct block write routines
		should a large write chunk overlap a cached disk
		fragment still in the cache.
cg max buffers	This is a configurable maximum number of cylinder group
		summary slots (filesystem block size memory chunks)
		which are to be dedicated to caching cylinder group
		summary information.
max buffers	A configurable maximum number of disk fragment size memory
		blocks which are dedicated to the main disk fragment cache.
                This number is translatable into the number of buffers
                reported by AddBuffers; however AddBuffers reports this
                value in 512 byte blocks.  This may change as it's really
                just BFFS's interface with the AddBuffers command.
total buffers	The number of disk buffers allocated by the filesystem.
		In general, this number will be the same as the max
		buffers, except when the max buffers are changed from
		inside BFFSTool.  In that case, the change will not
		take effect until the next disk change, or the next
		AddBuffers command.
in use buffers	The number of cache disk fragment buffers currently in
		use by the filesystem.
dirty buffers	The number of cache disk fragment buffers which have
		not yet been written to disk.  Usually, this value will
		be zero unless the filesystem is busy writing files.
locked buffers	The number of disk fragment buffers which have been
		internally locked by the filesystem.  When the filesystem
		is not servicing a request, you should never see a value
                other than zero.  This is because the internal routines
                will unlock buffers before completion of a packet.


GENERAL HANDLER INFORMATION:
----------------------------
read opens	The number of files (successfully and unsuccessfully)
		opened for read from the disk.
read groups	The number of raw disk transfers which have been
		requested of the disk device to read.
read Kbytes	The number of kilobytes which have been requested of
		the disk device to read.
write opens	The number of files (successfully and unsuccessfully)
		opened for write to the disk.
write groups	The number of raw disk transfers which have been
		requested of the disk device to write.
write Kbytes	The number of kilobytes which have been requested of
		the disk device to write.
locates		The number of times an individual file was locked
		via the ACTION_LOCATE packet (Lock() in dos.library)
examines	The number of examine packets which have been sent
		to the filesystem handler by AmigaOS.
examinenexts	The number of examine next packets which have been
		sent to the filesystem handler by AmigaOS.
flushes		The number of times the cache was flushed by a timer
		expire or by an ACTION_FLUSH packet sent manually.
renames		The number of files which have been renamed.
sync timer	The number of seconds idle write packet time (no write
		packets have been received within this time) to flush
		out the cache data to disk.  This is so when the
		filesystem is idle, it can put the disk to use writing
		back all the cached dirty disk data (and then turning
		the floppy motor off).
sync stalls	The number of seconds to retry a cache flush before
                forcing a cache flush anyway.  A cache flush will be
                suspended if new dirty data has landed in the cache since
		the last check.  The check is performed one a second.
		Once there are too many stalls, the cache flush will be
		forced.  This serves two purposes:
		o  Even in an system actively writing to the disk, the
		   filesystem "often" gets a chance to checkpoint and
		   sync a consistent filesystem structure.
		o  Flushing out the cache improves performance in an
		   active system since those dirty fragments are
		   for regular read cache use until they have been
		   synchronized with the media.
GMT offset	The number of hours (plus or minus) that the local
		time varies from GMT time.  This is mainly used to
		synchronize your AmigaOS view of the file timestamp with
		the UNIX file timestamp (which is always GMT).
PreAlloc	Representation of the current BFFS settings (checkboxes
		and GMT offset) which are adjustable in BFFSTool.  This
		value can be inserted for the PreAlloc field in the
	        MountList or RDB if you want to mount with those settings
		as default.
media start	This is the sector address of the physical disk where
		the active filesystem partition is being accessed.
media end	This is the upper bounding sector address of the
		physical disk where the active filesystem partition
		is being accessed.  All data accesses are checked
		for validity within this range (to prevent media
		corruption causing additional possible corruption).
version		This is a comment field filled by the filesystem to
		describe the current running version of BFFS.  You
		will notice the version number followed by some
		letters.  The letters you see detail the following:
		r  Handler can handle removable media.  Your version
			will probably have this option turned on.
		R  Filesystem handler is compiled to only read the
			disk and never allow writes.  This makes the
			BFFS code much smaller, as no write code is
			then compiled in.
		E  Handler uses extended packets to talk with the
			disk device.  Since not all devices are able
			to use extended packets, your distribution
			will probably have this option turned off.
		I  Intel byte ordering code.  This version of the
			filesystem has been compiled to support Intel
			(little-endian) byte ordering for the filesystem
			metadata (ie: 386i and 386BSD).  This, of course
			automatically makes the filesystem incompatible
			with Motorola byte ordering filesystems, which
			include Sun SPARC, and Amiga.  This version
			should be able to read both Sun 386i and NetBSD
			x86 filesystems.  The required translation code
			makes the filesystem code larger and run slower.
		.  When directories are examined by user programs, the
			filesystem will automatically show . and ..
			This option is not compiled in by default to provide
			compatibility with older programs which recursively
			traverse a filesystem, so they don't infinite loop.
		P  File permission checking is not performed with this
			version of the filesystem.  This makes the filesystem
			code only slightly faster.
		F  Handler compiled with Fast mode.  This means that all
			filesystem consistency checking is turned off, but
			the filesystem performs faster.  Using this version of
			the filesystem is a bit dangerous because a corrupt
                        filesytem can potentially be corrupted MUCH worse if
                        it's not detected early. 
		D  Filesytem is compiled with debugging messages turned on.
			This increases the size of the filesystem and slows it
			down.  This version of the filesystem is useful if you
			notice a problem (corruption, crash, etc) and would
			like to report the problem to the author.  The debug
			output would be useful in tracking down the cause.
		The above flags are set at compile-time and can not be
		modified by the user of the filesystem.
disk type	This field presents information about what BFFS thinks
		of the filesystem it is handling (as far as disk structure
		is concerned).	The first text (if present) is either
		"Sun" or "BSD" if a disk partition label is present, and
		was automatically sensed by the filesystem.  Note that if
		the Reserved parameter in the MountList is -1, then this
		text will not show.  If no disk label is present, then
		the handler device name will be shown instead.	This field
		may also say "dev:Dsk?" indicating no disk is in the drive.
		You may also see "dev:Bad?" which means the superblock is
		unreadable.  If you see "dev:Dev?" this suggests a problem
		in the MountList.  If the disk was mounted successfully,
		the next part will have the format "%cd%d%c"  The first
		%c will be the first character of the device driver.
		The %d is the physical unit on that device.  The last
		%c is the partition that was actually mounted.	So, for
		example, if you have a Sun floppy in bf0: (and are using
		messydisk.device or mfm.device, you should see: "Sun md0a"
		Otherwise, if you have a Sun hard drive at scsi.device unit
		0, you may see "Sun sd0a"


SUPERBLOCK INFORMATION:
-----------------------
frags free	The number of disk fragments which are not yet allocated to a
		file.  Note that this number should stay relatively small, as
		the filesystem attempts not to break full filesystem blocks if
		partial full blocks (multiple disk frags) are located nearby.
blocks free	The total number of full filesystem blocks which have not yet
		been allocated to files.
inodes free	The number of disk file descriptors still available.  If this
		number falls to zero, no mores files may be allocated.
num dirs	The number if directories present in the filesystem.  Note
		that the root directory counts as one.
block size	The number of bytes which make up a full filesystem disk block
		as parameterized by the newfs command.	Note that this value
		must be a multiple (from 1x to 8x) the size of the frag size.
		Allowed values for the block size are 4096, 8192, 16384, or
		32768.
frag size	The number of bytes which make up a disk fragment, as
		parameterized by the newfs command.  This number must always
		be a power of two less-than-or-equal to the block size.  It
		must also be greater-than-or-equal to the physical disk
		sector size.
num inodes	The total number of inodes which were parameterized as
		available when the filesystem was created.  By subtracting
		the number of inodes free, you can get the number of inodes
		in use.
data frags	Number of total disk block fragments which are allocatable to
		disk files.  This is basically the total filesystem size (num
		frags) minus the static filesystem overhead allocation.
num frags	The length of the filesystem in disk block fragments.  Note
		that this number is considerably more than the actual usable
		space of the filesystem.
num cgs		The number of individual disk cylinder groups parameterized
		when the filesystem was created (newfs).
num cyl		The number of disk cylinders involved in the entire
		filesystem.  This number is also chosen by newfs, but
		typically corresponds to the number of cylinders in the
		partition of the physical media.
sec/track	The number of sectors in a single disk track.
track/cyl	The number of tracks (disk heads) in a single cylinder.
cyl/cg		The number of disk cylinders parameterized by newfs to be
		logically located in the same cylinder group.
frags/cg	The number of disk block fragments per cylinder group.
inodes/cg	The number of inodes parameterized by newfs to be available
		(allocated within) each cylinder group.
minfree		The minimum free disk space to report (percentage).
modified	The number of modifications to the superblock since the last
		flush.  If this is non-zero, then the disk is considered out
		of sync with memory.
clean		This value should always be zero while the handler is active
		with the disk.	It is used to indicate in the superblock
		that the filesystem was cleanly unmounted.


BUTTONS:
--------
Refresh		This button asks the filesystem for an update on the
		filesystem status information shown.
Sync		This button asks the filesystem to FLUSH its dirty cache disk
		fragments to disk immediately.	You will notice dirty buffers
		go to zero (unless the disk is VERY active).
Clear		Clear the value of the operating statistics.  This is a
		non-dangerous operation, as the filesystem just provides the
		clearable statistics for BFFSTool to report.
Quit		This button Quits BFFSTool, returning you to the CLI.
Auto Symlink	This box allows you to turn on and off the automatic
		symlink resolution in the filesystem.  Many older AmigaOS
		programs will crash if they run into a soft link and attempt
		to resolve it.  You can enable this option if you run into
		a problem with one.
Ignore Case	This box allows you to turn on and off the case independence
		you have grown used to with AmigaOS.  When off, multiple files
		with the same name (just different case) can be created in
		a directory.  When reading a file, the exact case must be
		used to open the file.  When on, you can still access the
		files having only a difference of case in the name, but you
		must exactly specify the case to get at a specific file.
		Having "Ignore case" on may be necessary when trying to use a
		UNIX filesystem with files such as "Makefile" and "makefile"
Link Comments	This box allows you to turn on and off directory comments for
		"special" files; symbolic links and character/block special
		devices.
Inode Comments	This box allows you to turn on and off directory comments for
		files showing UNIX inode number, permissions, uid, gid, number
		of links, nunber of physical disk (512 byte) blocks, and
		number of bytes allocated to the file.	Note that directory
		listings are faster if you have comments disabled.
Unix Paths	This box allows you to turn on and off the UNIX path parser.
		When on, / is a reference to the root directory.
		When off, / is instead a reference to the parent directory.
		Use this if you want BFFS to be compatible with an
		unconfigurable package.  Note that this option directly
		conflicts with UNIX-like Amiga shells, as they will typically
		do the "/" and ".." translation for you.
Read Only	This box represents the superblock flag indicating
		whether this filesystem is mounted read-write or read-only.
		You may change this status at any time, so long as the
		filesystem is not the read-only variant.
Show Minfree	Checking this box makes the filesystem report available disk
		space as relative to the minfree percentage specified in the
		superblock.
Grp/Otr Bits	This box when checked inverts the meaning of the permission
		bits for group and other.  Apparently there was some late
		indecision at Commodore regarding the final meaning of
		these bits.  This provides a work-around should you need it.
		Note that BFFS ignores the GRP/OTR bits, but interprets
		and passes them on to the user application on request.
Bottom right	is a Cycle gadget which allows you to choose the BFFS handler
		with which you want to communicate.  BFFSTool "knows" which
		handlers are active in the system and it will only let
		you query an active BFFS 1.3 or higher filesystem handler.
		You may have to access the filesystem for the first time
		before BFFSTool will let you look at it.

Finally, you will notice miniature up/down button gadgets near "cg max
buffers", "max buffers", "sync timer", "sync stalls", and "GMT offset."
These are for incrementing and decrementing the value of the BFFS static
parameter for the filesystem.

Enjoy.
