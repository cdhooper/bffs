Version 1.3 of dcp
------------------------------------------------------------------------

dcp - device copy program for AmigaDOS.


dcp is a program which replaces filetodev/devtofile.  It allows
copying to/from devices and it determines automatically the types
and sizes of the source and destination.

** WARNING **
    If you don't know what this program does, DO NOT RUN IT.  It does
    NOT deal with filesystems at all when manipulating a raw device.
    If you only specify the destination name as a device, it will write
    on the RAW device.  If you had a filesystem there, it would most
    assuredly be corrupted.  For those that understand this warning, you
    might want to take a look at the code anyway.  For those that do not
    understand this warning, erase this package now.

Command line options:
    -b = specify buffer size
    -m = specify maximum blocks to transfer
    -ss = specify source block number at which to start
    -ds = specify destination block number at which to start
    -v = turn on verbose mode
    -h = give more help

Examples:
    dcp dh1: ram:junk
        Will copy the entire dh1: device to the file ram:junk

    dcp floppy df0:
        Will copy the file floppy to device df0:

    dcp dh2: dh3:
        Will copy device dh2: to device dh3:

    dcp myfile1 myfile2
        Will copy file myfile1 to file myfile2 (same as AmigaDOS copy,
                that partial blocks are not copied)

    dcp -ss 200 -m 8192 junk_file hddisk.device,3
        Will copy 8192 blocks of file junk_file to device 3 of hddisk.device
                starting at block 200 of the device

    dcp -m 1 scsi.device,0 -
        Will dump the first block of SCSI unit 0 to stdout (the screen)
