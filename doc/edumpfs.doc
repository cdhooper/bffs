Version 1.5 of edumpfs
------------------------------------------------------------------------

edumpfs - a program to display metadata pertaining to one or more
          Berkeley Fast File Systems in the specified AmigaDOS device.


The edumpfs utility enables the user to discover file system low level
information for the specified AmigaDOS device.  Specifically, edumpfs
will tell if a disk partition label can be found.  If one can be found,
edumpfs will display the partitioning layout for either Sun or BSD disk
label formats.  edumpfs knows how to properly decode x86 BSD FFS
filesystem information as well.

Next, edumpfs will display the first superblock in the partition.
Following the superblock will be the filesystem cylinder group summary
information.  This process will be repeated for every partition found in
the disk label.  If you specify (on the command line) the exact partition
you want edumpfs to show, only that partition will be displayed.  This is
done by providing the partition letter (or number) following the AmigaDOS
device name.  Example:
    edumpfs bf0:c

You may also specify a device by the driver name and unit number.
Example:
    edumpfs uaehf.device,0

Full syntax for this format is
    <driver>,<unit>,<flags>,<sectorsize>,<startsector>,<lastsector>
Other BFFS commands accepting an Amiga disk device also support this format.

edumpfs will display summary help text by running edumpfs with no parameters.
For more help, you can type "edumpfs -h"

Briefly, the command line options edumpfs supports are:
    -b      do not show boot label information
    -c      do not show cylinder group summary information
    -f      show bit detail of frags available
    -h      gives more help
    -i      show bit detail of inodes available
    -I      inverts the display of the free / used bits
    -l      do not read boot label information
    -s      specifies a non-standard starting sector for the superblock
    -S      do not show superblock information
