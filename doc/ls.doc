Version 1.2 of ls
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ls - A simple directory list utility


This program acts similar to the UNIX ls command, taking many of the
same command line arguments.


Usage:
    ls [<options>] <filename> [<filename>...]

Where 
    device is the optional device where the file exists

    filename is the name of the file to show

    You may specify as many filenames as you want to list.


Briefly, the command line options this program supports are:

    -a is show files which begin with a '.'
    -A is show AmigaDOS (not UNIX) permissions
    -c is sort by last inode change time
    -d is do not examine directory contents
    -f is do not sort, show all entries
    -F is add indicator for file type
    -g is show file groups
    -h is show human-readable sizes
    -H is show this help
    -i is show file inode number
    -l is show long listing
    -n is show numerical userid and group
    -p is put slash after directory names
    -r is reverse sort order
    -R is show recursive listing of directory
    -s is show file sizes in blocks
    -S is sort by file size
    -t is sort by last modify time
    -T is show full time (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss)
    -u is sort by last access time
    -1 is list one file per line

Files
    A user name mapping file is located in the following order:
        ENV:passwd
        S:passwd
        DEVS:passwd
        INET:db/passwd
    A group name mapping file is located in the following order:
        ENV:group
        S:group
        DEVS:group
        INET:db/group

    Entries may be separated by vertical bar (|) or colon (:)

    Example passwd file:
        root|*|65535|6535|Root|sys:|shell
        cdh|*|1640|10|Chris Hooper|sys:|shell
    Example group file:
        sys:2
        bin:3
