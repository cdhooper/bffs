rdb - edit the RDB (Rigid Disk Block) area of an AmigaDOS disk device


This program functions in place of HDToolBox for controllers which
support the RDB area, but refuse to work with HDToolBox.  My IVS
TrumpCard is one such beast.  The rdb utility allows you to tweak most
RDB parameters (including those HDToolBox won't let you touch), so if
you don't know what you are doing, I don't recommend you use this program.

Usage:
    rdb <disk.device> <unit> [<option> | <keyword>=<value> ...]

Where 
    disk.device is the physical disk device driver

    unit is the physical disk unit on that driver

    option can be any of:
        -rigid = edit fields in the Rigid Disk Block
        -part NAME = modify partition table parameters of NAME
        -newpart NAME = add new partition NAME to the RDB
        -promote NAME = make partition NAME first to be mounted
        -extract DOSTYPE = extract filesystem to a file 
        -avail = report next available block in RDB
        -seglist = show seglist addresses for filesystems
        -help = give more help
        
    keyword can be any of:
        Fields in the RDB disk header
            HostID BlockBytes RigidFlags BadBlockList PartitionList
            FileSysHeaderList DriveInit Cylinders Sectors Heads
            Interleave Park WritePreComp ReducedWrite StepRate
            RDBBlocksLo RDBBlocksHi LoCylinder HiCylinder CylBlocks
            AutoParkSeconds DiskVendor DiskProduct DiskRevision
            ControllerVendor ControllerProduct ControllerRev
        Fields in the Partition header
            Next Flags DevFlags DriveName Surfaces BlocksPerTrack
            Reserved PreAlloc Interleave LowCyl HighCyl NumBuffers
            BufMemType MaxTransfer Mask BootPri DosType

Lackage:
    The program is able to dump filesystem handlers from the
    rdb area to a regular DOS file.  It should also allow
    transfers in the opposite direction.  ie: Installation of
    a new filesystem handler in the rdb area.  It doesn't allow
    this today.

Coolness:
    rdb is able to repair damaged RDB areas (well, it can fix
    the checksum on RDB blocks for you).

    Parameters to rdb may appear in any order and are case-
    insensitive.  Also, the "=" is optional for settings. Rdb
    will ask before making any changes to your disk structure.


Example:
    You want to change the boot priority of DH0: on your machine
    using scsi.device, unit 6
        rdb scsi.device 6 -part DH0 bootpri=10
