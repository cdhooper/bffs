------------------------------------------------------------------------

mknod - create Unix special device nodes


This program acts nearly identical to the Unix command of the same name.


Usage:
	mknod <type> <major> <minor> <filename> [<filename>...]

Where 
	type is either b (block special) or c (character special)

	major is the major device number (0 to 16M)

	minor is the minor device number (0 to 255)

	devname is the name of the special file to create


	You are allowed to name as many files as you want to create
	with the same device attributes.
